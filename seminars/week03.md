# Week 3

This week's focus is on criticism and feedback.
First, we will discuss the observations which serve as the class project, which ties into this week's focus.
We will then talk about how to deliver criticism and what constitutes effective feedback, and tie that to the reading from last week.
Finally, we will segue into a short introduction to emotional intelligence, which we will cover in more detail next week.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Assignment for This Week

Read through Chapter 3 of *Emotional Intelligence* by Daniel Goleman.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Readings?preview=5682328).
We started discussing emotional intelligence at the end of today, and we will finish discussing it next week.

### Review

The review format is adapted from the format for the [paper reviews for ECS 201C](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS201C/blob/master/syllabus.md#paper-reviews) by Jason Lowe-Power.

Write a review of the reading above.
Your review should contain two short paragraphs:

1. A short summary of the reading, and any key insights or implications.
2. Your own thoughts about the reading. Anything that stood out or resonated with you, or a topic/question about it for next week.

Submit your review in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310488).

### Grading

I'm looking to see if you read the paper.
I am not going to grade this that harshly.
That being said, if it's clear from your review that you didn't read the paper, you may not receive full credit.
