# Week 3

This week's focus is on criticism and feedback.
First, we will discuss the change in the class project.
We will then talk about how to deliver criticism and what constitutes effective feedback, and tie that to the reading from last week.
Finally, we will segue into a short introduction to emotional intelligence, which we will cover in more detail next week.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Change in Class Project [10 min]

*Explain the change in the class project.*

### Explanation

Due to the small class size, and the smaller number of TAs, I'm cancelling the discussion observations.
I don't want anybody to feel as if they're being singled out by an observer.
Instead, we're going to fall back to the assignments I used in Fall Quarter 2018.

### Tracks

There's two different tracks, depending on whether or not you'll be leading discussions this quarter or not.
For discussion leaders, your assignment involves me observing one of your discussions.
If you're not leading discussions, either because you're only grading or you're not a TA this quarter, then you're going to have an alternative assignment revolving around exposing you to something new in terms of teaching.

In terms of grading, it will be worth the same amount as the original observation, so 10% of your grade.

#### Track A - Discussion Observations

I will be observing one of your discussion sections sometime this quarter.
You have already submitted a list of when and where your discussions are in [the first assignment](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310478).

I will email you to confirm the date and time of one of your discussions.
Once we've confirmed, I'll observe that discussion and give you feedback.
You can see the style of feedback that I'll be giving in the `observations/` folder [here on GitHub](../observations).

For the observation itself, you will start on time like normal.
Five minutes before your discussion ends, I will ask you to leave the room, and I will take both positive feedback and constructive criticism from the class in the remaining five minutes.
I'll send you the feedback from the class and myself through email sometime after the observation.

#### Track B - CEE Workshop Attendance

The [Center for Educational Effectiveness](https://cee.ucdavis.edu/) (or CEE) promotes and supports effective learning for all UC Davis students.
You're probably already met them at TA orientation.
CEE holds workshops every quarter on a variety of topics to help you improve your teaching.
This quarter's emphasis is on hybrid and online courses.

Your assignment will be to attend a CEE workshop, and write a short paragraph on what you learned there.
The paragraph doesn't need to be very detailed, I'm just curious as to what you learned.
You can view all the available workshops on [CEE's website](https://ucdavis.app.box.com/s/ijoz1t6a03noas1c5g3kkzducs5uagpt).
Feel free to attend any one that strikes your fancy, though keep in mind some of the workshops are oriented towards faculty and not graduate students.

Note that you need to register ahead of time on each event's page.
When you submit your paragraph, also attach a screenshot of the registration confirmation email that you get from CEE.

## Criticism and Tone [15 min]

*How your method of delivering information matters.*

### Reading From Last Week

To start this topic, we will talk about the paper reading from last week.
I'll ask about what its insights were on feedback, and if the authors mentioned anything about tone.
After that, I'll ask for any comments or questions on the reading.

### Slides

Next, we'll go through some slides on effective feedback.
You can find these slides in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Seminar%20Materials?preview=5691739).
These slides were adapted from ones provided by the *MaGE* Program.

After we go through the slides, I will ask for any questions about what we just talked about.

## Discussing Effective Feedback [15 min]

*What do you think makes feedback effective?*

### Poll

Now that we have covered a bit about tone, let's move to a discussion about your experiences with feedback.

I will pass around a questionnaire to each person that will look like the ballot from week 1.
Please write your name on the questionnaire, as this will serve as the sign in sheet for today.
There will be one question on the questionnaire.
Please mark *Yes* or *No* on the questionnaire in response to the following question:

> Have you ever had a negative experience with receiving feedback from somebody else?

*Only I will know exactly what you marked.
I will not reveal your specific choice to anyone else, though I will reveal the results in the aggregate to further the discussion.
What you mark will have no impact on your grade, as I am only grading on attendance.*

Afterwards, I will collect the questionnaire and count them.
When I have finished counting, I will reveal the results in the aggregate.

### Discussion

After the poll, we will discuss your interactions and feelings about feedback.
As a TA, part of your role may be giving feedback to students via grading, so if you serve in that capacity, you will influence the learning experiences that your students will have.

### Prompts

I'll ask how feedback has affected you personally.
It can be good or bad.
You can also talk about how it impacted you at the time, or how you feel when you think back on it.

From there, I'll allow the discussion to flow naturally.
I'll share my own experiences with feedback and criticism, if the discussion permits.
If there's a lull, I'll ask the following, but we're not required to get to them all.

* Can you think of any moment when someone gave you very "unbuffered" feedback? How did it make you feel? What impact did it have on you going forward?
* Can you think of any moments when it was easy for you to receive criticism? Why do you think it was easy?
* What kind of feedback from instructors do you find most helpful? Is there a particular format that works better for you?

### Further Reading

These examples were provided to me by Jason Lowe-Power of UC Davis.

[This feedback rubric](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Seminar%20Materials?preview=5745772) from UC Merced provides some useful examples of what is useful feedback, and what isn't.
You can also look at [this 3 minute video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-aaKMva4lc) from the same group at UC Merced.

## What is Emotional Intelligence [10 min]

*A brief introduction to emotional intelligence.*

### Introduction

I'll ask if anybody has heard of emotional intelligence (EI) before.
We'll have a brief discussion about what we think it means.

### Slides

To finish today, we will go through some slides on EI.
You can find these slides in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Seminar%20Materials?preview=5692003).
These slides were adapted from ones provided by the *MaGE* Program.

After we go through the slides, I will ask for any questions about what we just talked about.

## Assignment for This Week

*Furthering your understanding of emotional intelligence.*

### Reading

Read through Chapter 3 of *Emotional Intelligence* by Daniel Goleman.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Readings?preview=5682328).
We started discussing emotional intelligence at the end of today, and we will finish discussing it next week.

### Review

The review format is adapted from the format for the [paper reviews for ECS 201C](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS201C/blob/master/syllabus.md#paper-reviews) by Jason Lowe-Power.

Write a review of the reading above.
Your review should contain two short paragraphs:

1. A short summary of the reading, and any key insights or implications.
2. Your own thoughts about the reading. Anything that stood out or resonated with you, or a topic/question about it for next week.

Submit your review in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310488).

### Grading

I'm looking to see if you read the paper.
I am not going to grade this that harshly.
That being said, if it's clear from your review that you didn't read the paper, you may not receive full credit.
