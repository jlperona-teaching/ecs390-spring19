# Week 7

This week's focus is on your role as a TA.
We'll go over what a TA's purpose is in a course.
From there, we'll discuss some guidelines and responsibilities for being a TA in CS at UC Davis.

Some of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Purpose of TAs [10 min]

*What hats do TAs wear?*

### Discussion

To start with, we'll have a brief discussion about the role of a TA.
This will provide context for the next topic, which is about guidelines and responsibilities.

I'll ask what is the purpose and role of a TA.
We touched on this in the assignment from last week about *hats* that instructors wear, so I'll ask about your answer to that question.
From there, I'll let the conversation flow naturally.

### Common Responses

To finish our discussion, I will show this list of common responses to this question and we will discuss them.
This list isn't a definitive answer to the question, but these responses are certainly worth considering.

* TAs are there to help students who are struggling with a specific problem or bug.
* TAs are there to provide a resource for students who might not feel comfortable asking a professor for help.
* TAs are not there to provide students with answers.
* TAs are not there to tell students whether they belong in the class.

## Teaching Guidelines and Responsibilities [40 min]

*Guidance for teaching CS at UC Davis.*

### Poll

Before we continue, I want to see how many students have been or are currently TAs.
Interestingly enough, this information isn't easily available, even to someone who is teaching a TA training course!
I'll use the results to this question to tailor the next section appropriately.

I will pass around a questionnaire to each person that will look like previous ballots in the class.
Please write your name on the questionnaire, as this will serve as the sign in sheet for today.
There will be one question on the questionnaire.
Please mark *Yes* or *No* on the questionnaire in response to the following question:

> Have you been or are you currently a TA here at UC Davis?

*Only I will know exactly what you marked.
I will not reveal your specific choice to anyone else, though I will reveal the results in the aggregate to further the discussion.
What you mark will have no impact on your grade, as I am only grading on attendance.*

Afterwards, I will collect the questionnaire and count them.
When I have finished counting, I will reveal the results in the aggregate.

### Notes

Now that we have some context, we're going to go over some guidelines and responsibilities for teaching CS here at UC Davis.
This was originally developed by Sean Davis, who was a long-time lecturer here before retiring a couple of years ago.
I took his version of this and added some of my own observations and notes to it.
You can find the PDF version of it [here on GitHub](../notes/teaching-guidelines-responsibilities.pdf).

We will go over this for the rest of the class.
I will try to make it somewhat interactive rather than a straight lecture on the material.

## Assignment for This Week

*Tools and other technology to make your teaching more effective.*

### Reading

Read through *Technology We Can't Live Without!, revisited* by Ria Galanos, Michael Ball, John Dougherty, Joe Hummel, and David J. Malan.
This was originally published in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2018.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Readings?preview=5837174).
This is a short 2-page paper about tools used in computer science education.
The presentation next week will talk about some tools in use at UC Davis, and we'll have a discussion if there's time.

### Questions

You don't need to review the paper this time.
Instead, answer the following three questions:

1. Have you used, or are currently using, any of the educational tools that the authors mentioned?
2. Are there any tools on this list that you haven't used that may be useful to you in the future?
3. Are there any tools *not* on this list that you think are worth mentioning?

Submit your responses in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310492).

### Grading

As long as you respond to the questions appropriately, you'll get credit.
