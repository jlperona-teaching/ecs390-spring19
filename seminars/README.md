# Seminars

This folder contains the schedule for each week's seminar.
`week09.md` is missing since that week is a holiday this quarter.

Topics are heavily based on the [MaGE Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the MaGE Program.
Unlike the topics provided on the MaGE Resources website, these are written to be student-facing.
As the class goes through a topic, the instructions and notes for that topic can be displayed on the projector to remind students what they're currently doing.
