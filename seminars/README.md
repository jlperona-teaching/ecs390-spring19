# Seminars

This folder contains the schedule for each week's seminar.
`week09.md` is missing since that week is a holiday this quarter.

## Format

Each week is broken up into constituent topics that are ordered chronologically.

Each file is written in Markdown due to its flexibility.
I use Markdown pretty much everywhere else, and it continues to make sense here.

## Inspiration

Topics are heavily based on the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

Unlike the topics provided on the *MaGE* resources website, these are written to be student-facing.
As the class goes through a topic, the instructions and notes for that topic can be displayed on the projector to remind students what they're currently doing.
