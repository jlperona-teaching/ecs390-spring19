# Week 8

This week's focus is on educational tools, particularly those used in CS education here at UC Davis.
We will have a faculty presenter here to talk about tools that he's used.
If there's time, then we will have a longer discussion on these tools.

## Faculty Presentation

*Advice from somebody who's been doing this for a while.*

### Presenter

Our presenter this week is [Christopher Nitta](https://csiflabs.cs.ucdavis.edu/~cjnitta/), a Lecturer with Potential for Security of Employment in Computer Science here at UC Davis.
I've known him since 2014, when I was an undergraduate here at UC Davis.
He was the one that introduced me to Gradescope, which I have found invaluable for grading quizzes and exams.

I will ask him about Gradescope and other educational tools that he's used.
From there, I'll let the discussion flow naturally.

### Attendance

After the introduction, I will pass around a sign in sheet to each person that will look like the ballots from previous classes.
Please write your name down on your sign in sheet.
I will collect them at the end of class.

## Educational Tools [if time]

*Discussing the use of educational tools and their impact on students.*

### Discussion

If we have some time left over after Chris's presentation, we will segue into a conversation about educational tools.
I'd love to hear about the tools you're currently using and what you think works well in your classes.
I'd also like to hear about what you think *doesn't* work well in your classes.

We can also talk about other tools that didn't show up on in the paper.
There's plenty of them, but some of the ones I've heard of include [*Mimir*](https://www.mimirhq.com/), [*GitHub Education*](https://education.github.com/) (different than the way I used GitHub for this class), [*zyBooks*](https://www.zybooks.com/), [*Kodethon*](https://www.kodethon.com/#/), and others.

## Assignment for This Week

*The beginning of the end.*

### Logistics

*Note*: there is no class next Monday, 2019-05-27, due to the Memorial Day holiday.
You have two weeks to do this assignment, which is due on Monday, 2019-06-03 at 16:00.

### Final Questions

The first part of the last class will be devoted to bringing it all back and answering any final questions that you may have about topics we covered.
If you have a question or topic that you'd like to discuss further at the beginning of the next class, write it down.
Otherwise, if you don't have a question or topic to discuss further, write down something you've learned or gotten better at over the course of this class.
*I will keep your responses anonymous, but I will use these as a talking point next time we meet.*

Submit your question or response in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310493).

### Grading

As long as you respond to the question(s) appropriately, you'll get credit.
