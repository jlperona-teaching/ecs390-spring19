# Week 10

This week concludes the course.
You'll have one last chance to ask any questions that you have on topics that we've covered in the course.
I'll point out some other educational resources that may be helpful in your role as a TA.
Finally, we'll wrap things up and I'll ask for your feedback.

### Feedback

There are two sets of feedback to fill out to finish off the class.
Only one of them is going to be graded, though.
In addition, if you haven't done your track assignment yet, that needs to be finished this week.
There's one last CEE workshop tomorrow; check [CEE's graduate student workshop flyer](https://ucdavis.app.box.com/s/ijoz1t6a03noas1c5g3kkzducs5uagpt) for more information.

*Note that the homework for this week is due on Thursday at 23:59.*
It's due before the start of finals so I can finalize the grades as quickly as possible.

#### Feedback on the Curriculum

*This feedback will be graded, but only on completion.*

The [assignment on Canvas for this week](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310494) contains a link to a Google Form with the feedback.
The focus is on the curriculum, how you felt about it, and if there was anything that you felt I could have added.

As mentioned above, you will only be graded on completion.
As long as you submit the Google Form, you'll get credit, no matter your opinions.
I'd like for you to be honest in your feedback and let me know if this class was useful for you.
I will use this feedback to determine if I will continue to offer 390 in this format, and what changes I should make if I do.

#### Feedback for Me

*This feedback will not be graded.*

This set of feedback can be found on UC Davis' [Academic Course Evaluations](https://eval.ucdavis.edu/).
You'll probably get an email every single day that you still need to fill out feedback for any of your classes.
The focus is more on me and the class as a whole, rather than the curriculum itself.

As mentioned above, you won't be graded on this, and it's not mandatory.
Since it's completely anonymous, I can't grade you on it.
There's also no way for me to compel you to fill it out, but I ask that you do, and that you do so honestly.
I will use any positive and constructive feedback to help me determine how to make future classes better.
