# Week 10

This week concludes the course.
I'll bring up some of the topics mentioned in the previous week's homework; you'll then have one last chance to ask any questions that you have on topics that we've covered in the course.
I'll point out some other educational resources that may be helpful in your role as a TA.
Finally, we'll wrap things up and I'll ask for your feedback.

## Bringing It All Back [5 min]

*Making connections to the rest of the course.*

### Assignment From Last Week

The assignment from last week asked you about topics that you'd like to discuss further, or to talk about things that you've learned or gotten better at over the course of this class.
We're going to spend the first part of this final class talking about answers to that first question: things to discuss further.

## Topics for Further Discussion [35 min]

*Guided discussion based on your responses to the previous homework.*

### Dismissive Students

One of the topics brought up made an impact on me, which is why we're going to spend some time talking about it.
*Note that this is a serious topic.*
Please keep this conversation respectful.

#### Scenario

A student walks into your office hours, attended by multiple other students, and asks those present who the TA is.
After determining that you are the TA, the student makes a comment along the lines of "never mind, I'll come back later and talk to somebody else."
The student then leaves.

#### First Discussion

We'll spend some time discussing answers to the following questions.
I don't believe there is necessarily one correct answer to these questions.

* How do you think situations like these affect the learning environment in classes?
* What is an appropriate way to handle this situation?
* Would your answer be different if the power dynamic was different, if you weren't the student's TA?

#### Second Scenario

This next scenario is similar to the first, with some significant changes.

A student walks into your office hours, attended by multiple other students, and asks those present who the TA is.
After determining that you are the TA, the student makes a comment along the lines of "never mind, I don't think you can handle it."
The student then leaves.

You have reason to believe that the student made the comment based on a group, class, or category to which they perceived you belonged to.
This includes but is not limited to race, ethnicity, nationality, gender or gender expression, and/or age.

#### Attendance

Before we begin discussing the second scenario, I want to know if you've heard of the [UC Davis Principles of Community](https://occr.ucdavis.edu/poc/).
It will be relevant to this discussion.

I will pass around a questionnaire to each person that will look like previous ballots in the class.
Please write your name on the questionnaire, as this will serve as the sign in sheet for today.
There will be one question on the questionnaire.
Please mark an appropriate response on the questionnaire in response to the following questions:

> Have you heard of the UC Davis Principles of Community prior to today?
> Have you read its contents prior to today?

*Only I will know exactly what you marked.
I will not reveal your specific choice to anyone else, though I will reveal the results in the aggregate to further the discussion.
What you mark will have no impact on your grade, as I am only grading on attendance.*

Afterwards, I will collect the questionnaires and count them.
When I have finished counting, I will reveal the results in the aggregate.

#### Second Discussion

Before we continue, I will briefly go through the [UC Davis Principles of Community](https://occr.ucdavis.edu/poc/).
After we do so, we'll spend some time discussing answers to the following questions.
Again, I don't believe there is necessarily one correct answer to these questions.

* Why are the Principles of Community relevant here?
* What is an appropriate way to handle this situation? Is your answer different from your answer to the first scenario?
* The intentions behind the student's comment may not be clear. Does this complicate how you would respond to the student?

### Further Topics

**This section is incomplete.
It will be finished after the assignment is due.**

## Final Questions [if time]

*Lingering thoughts.*

### One Last Chance

If there's time, I'll ask for any remaining questions that you have.
It can be about topics that we've covered in this course, or something else that you'd like to bring up.

## Other Educational Resources [5 min]

*Other resources to help you continue to improve your teaching.*

### Resource List

In week 7, at the end of the [teaching guidelines and responsibilities notes](../notes/teaching-guidelines-responsibilities.pdf), I mentioned some resources if you want to improve your teaching.
Here's a recap, along with some additional ones that either your fellow students or I have found.

* The [Center for Educational Effectiveness](https://cee.ucdavis.edu/) (CEE) is the biggest resource for improving your teaching, with workshops, consultations, and a course that you can take.
* Other instructors, such as your fellow TAs and the instructors for the courses you TA for. I can't tell you how many things I've picked up from other instructors to use for my own courses!
* [This guide](https://www.ucop.edu/student-mental-health-resources/_files/pdf/ucd.pdf) is a good resource for assisting distressed and distressing students, if you ever find yourself in that situation.
* There's also [this gatekeeper training](https://staff.ucdavis.edu/article/gatekeeping-training-study) which is designed to help equip staff and faculty with skills and the knowledge they need to comfortably and confidently speak to students about mental health concerns, then refer them to appropriate mental health resources. However, I believe that it's targeted towards staff and faculty, not TAs.

Check out [our department's page on teaching resources](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/graduate/current/teaching/), too.
I add to it as I encounter new university resources.

## Wrap Up [10 min]

*Wrapping everything up.*

### What You've Improved On

From the assignment from the previous week, people mentioned that they learned about the following topics:

* Emotional intelligence
* Teaching tips and strategies

**This list above is incomplete.
It will be finished after the assignment is due.**

### Improving Never Ends

I hope that this class has introduced you to a new idea or given you the chance to improve some aspect of your teaching.
That said, this class shouldn't be the end of that journey.
You can *always* improve your teaching skills.
I'm constantly doing the same via learning from other instructors and trying new things, such as the new curriculum for this class.

Even if you're not going to be an instructor after your time in graduate school, some of these skills could still prove useful to you out in industry or elsewhere.
If you do end up becoming an educator, I hope that you continue to hone your teaching ability wherever life takes you next.

### Thank You

Finally, thank you for attending this class and bearing with me over these past 10 weeks.
I'd love your constructive feedback on what you liked and what could be done better; more on that in a bit.

I make an offer to all my students at the end of this class.
If you're serious about improving your teaching, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
Feel free to email me in the future if you'd like to talk, want me to point you to some resources, or have me do an observation of one of your discussions (or even lectures!).
I can't promise that I'll be in Davis forever on that last one, but we can try to make it work.

## Assignment for This Week

*One last thing before you go.*

### Feedback

There are two sets of feedback to fill out to finish off the class.
Only one of them is going to be graded, though.
In addition, if you haven't done your track assignment yet, that needs to be finished this week.
There's one last CEE workshop tomorrow; check [CEE's graduate student workshop flyer](https://ucdavis.app.box.com/s/ijoz1t6a03noas1c5g3kkzducs5uagpt) for more information.

*Note that the homework for this week is due on Thursday at 23:59.*
It's due before the start of finals so I can finalize the grades as quickly as possible.

#### Giving Good Feedback

In the spirit of this class being about improving your teaching ability, here's some resources about feedback from the [Students Assessing Teaching And Learning (SATAL) Program](https://cetl.ucmerced.edu/satal) from UC Merced.
Admittedly, this is for students rather than TAs or instructors, but I think it's useful to point out.

The SATAL Program created [this useful rubric](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/jqitg8o5zp125/j7z56pnupw9461/jt0c3yml2fz2/shs_rubric.pdf) on how to give useful feedback to instructors on their classes.
They've divided it into highly useful, somewhat useful, and not useful feedback that students can give to instructors to improve their courses and teaching.
There's also a three minute video [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-aaKMva4lc) if you prefer videos.

I'm not requiring you to read through the rubric or watch the video before you give me feedback, but I'd certainly appreciate it if you did.
It might even prove handy for you in future classes.

#### Feedback on the Curriculum

*This feedback will be graded, but only on completion.*

The [assignment on Canvas for this week](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310494) contains a link to a Google Form with the feedback.
The focus is on the curriculum, how you felt about it, and if there was anything that you felt I could have added.

As mentioned above, you will only be graded on completion.
As long as you submit the Google Form, you'll get credit, no matter your opinions.
I'd like for you to be honest in your feedback and let me know if this class was useful for you.
I will use this feedback to determine if I will continue to offer 390 in this format, and what changes I should make if I do.

#### Feedback for Me

*This feedback will not be graded.*

This set of feedback can be found on UC Davis' [Academic Course Evaluations](https://eval.ucdavis.edu/).
You'll probably get an email every single day that you still need to fill out feedback for any of your classes.
The focus is more on me and the class as a whole, rather than the curriculum itself.

As mentioned above, you won't be graded on this, and it's not mandatory.
Since it's completely anonymous, I can't grade you on it.
There's also no way for me to compel you to fill it out, but I ask that you do, and that you do so honestly.
I will use any positive and constructive feedback to help me determine how to make future classes better.
