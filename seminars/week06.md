# Week 6

This week's focus is on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and intersectionality.
These fall under the auspices of inclusiveness and climate, which we started to talk about last week.
First, we will cover UDL and how it connects to inclusiveness.
Then, we will start talking about intersectionality and how people's identities influence their experiences.

*Note*: in this week, we will go through some serious topics.
Please remember to respect each other's points of view, even if you don't relate to or agree with them.
I will do my best to facilitate these discussions, but I ask that you do your part as well to keep these discussions respectful.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Universal Design for Learning [20 min]

*Tying accessibility to inclusiveness.*

### Reading From Last Week

The reading from last week was all about UDL.
I'll ask for a short summary of the paper, akin to the first paragraph of your review.
In particular, I'll ask for the definition of UDL.
After that, I'll ask for any comments or questions on the reading.

### Examples

From there, we will go through some examples in the spirit of UDL.
These examples focus on improving the accessibility of classes and how that ties to the idea of inclusiveness.

#### Accessibility

Take some time to come up with examples of ways that classes can be more accessible to a wider variety of students.
I will write these on the board.

#### Impact

After we have come up with some examples to improve accessibility, we will go through each example in turn.
Describe the impact these examples might have on how a student feels in a class.
I will write these impacts on the board as well.

#### Personal Experiences

The previous topic had to do with impacts on students in a classroom.
Now, think of times when you have benefited from something being more accessible, even though you didn't *need* it to be that way.
We will talk about these.

If you can't think of any examples, here are two of them:

* Using an elevator to travel less than 5 floors, if you're also able to use the stairs.
* Sending a text message rather than discussing in person.

## Intersectionality and Lived Experience [30 min]

*How your identities influence your experiences.*

### Video

To introduce this topic, we will watch [this video from Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2kUpKP18z8) on intersectionality.

**Under construction.**

### Purpose

What do you think intersectionality has to do with this training and your job as a TA?

**Under construction.**

### Discussion

**Under construction.**

#### Splitting Into Groups

For this exercise, we're going to split into groups of 3 to 4.
Rearrange yourselves so that you can all discuss with the other members of your group.

Before we continue, I will provide a piece of scratch paper and a pen to each group.
*Make sure everybody in your group writes down their names on the scratch paper.
This is the sign-in sheet for today.*

**Under construction.**

#### Caveats

**Under construction.**

#### Prompts

**Under construction.**

* Which of your identities are you most conscious of in this setting? Can you think of any situations where you are more conscious of a different identity or identities?
* Can you think of any moments in your life when you felt excluded? What do you think made you feel excluded? What impact did that feeling of exclusion have on you in that situation?
* Can you think of any environments or situations where you feel like you belong or feel particularly safe? What do you think it was about those environments/situations that led you to feel that way?
* Can you think of any moments when you have made negative assumptions about someone that turned out not to be true? How did you react when you discovered you were wrong?
* Have you ever been in a situation when you intended to make someone feel one way, but the actual impact was not what you expected? Can you think of any moments when someone had an impact on you which was clearly different from what they intended?

Side point involving the last question: both intention and impact matter.
Good intentions don't excuse a negative impact that somebody has had, but acknowledging their intentions can be a good place to start if you want to productively communicate with them about that impact.

## Assignment for This Week

*Tips for instructors who are just starting out.*

### Reading

Read through *Teaching Tips We Wish They'd Told Us Before We Started* by Owen Astrachan, Nick Parlante, Daniel D. Garcia, and Stuart Reges.
This was originally published in the *ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education* in 2007.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Readings?preview=5837597).
This is a short 2-page paper about some teaching tips for new instructors.
While this is intended for professors and lecturers, some of these tips could be applicable in your role as a TA.
We will go further into TA roles and responsibilities next week.

### Questions

You don't need to review the paper this time.
Instead, answer the following two questions:

1. Is there anything on this list that you strongly agree or disagree with? Why is that the case?
2. The first paragraph mentions *hats*, or roles, that instructors wear. In a similar vein, name some of the hats that you wear when you are a TA. You can name them in general or specifically for a course you've TAed or are currently TAing for.

Submit your responses in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310491).

### Grading

As long as you respond to the questions appropriately, you'll get credit.
