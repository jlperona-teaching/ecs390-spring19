# Week 6

This week's focus is on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and intersectionality.
These fall under the auspices of inclusiveness and climate, which we started to talk about last week.
First, we will cover UDL and how it connects to inclusiveness.
Then, we will start talking about intersectionality and how people's identities influence their experiences.

*Note*: in this week, we will go through some serious topics.
Please remember to respect each other's points of view, even if you don't relate to or agree with them.
I will do my best to facilitate these discussions, but I ask that you do your part as well to keep these discussions respectful.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.
