# Week 5

This week marks our transition from emotional intelligence to inclusiveness and climate.
First, we will talk about our pet peeves, which will help transition us away from emotional intelligence.
Then, we will start talking about climate, and how the reading from last week ties into that.

*Note*: in this and the next week, we will go through some serious topics.
Please remember to respect each other's points of view, even if you don't relate to or agree with them.
I will do my best to facilitate these discussions, but I ask that you do your part as well to keep these discussions respectful.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Assignment for This Week

*Introducing the concept of Universal Design for Learning.*

### Reading

Read through *Universal Design: Implications for Computing Education* by Sheryl Burgstahler of the University of Washington, Seattle.
This was originally published in *ACM Transactions on Computing Education* in 2011.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Readings?preview=5760336).
We will start discussing Universal Design for Learning (UDL) next week, which continues our discussion on inclusiveness and climate.

### Review

The review format is adapted from the format for the [paper reviews for ECS 201C](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS201C/blob/master/syllabus.md#paper-reviews) by Jason Lowe-Power.

Write a review of the reading above.
Your review should contain two short paragraphs:

1. A short summary of the reading, and any key insights or implications.
2. Your own thoughts about the reading. Anything that stood out or resonated with you, or a topic/question about it for next week.

Submit your review in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310490).

### Grading

I'm looking to see if you read the paper.
I am not going to grade this that harshly.
That being said, if it's clear from your review that you didn't read the paper, you may not receive full credit.
