# Week 5

This week marks our transition from emotional intelligence to inclusiveness and climate.
First, we will talk about our pet peeves, which will help transition us away from emotional intelligence.
Then, we will start talking about climate, and how the reading from last week ties into that.

*Note*: in this and the next week, we will go through some serious topics.
Please remember to respect each other's points of view, even if you don't relate to or agree with them.
I will do my best to facilitate these discussions, but I ask that you do your part as well to keep these discussions respectful.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.
