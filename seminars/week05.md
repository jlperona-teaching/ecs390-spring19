# Week 5

This week marks our transition from emotional intelligence to inclusiveness and climate.
First, we will talk about our pet peeves, which will help transition us away from emotional intelligence.
Then, we will start talking about climate, and how the reading from last week ties into that.

*Note*: in this and the next week, we will go through some serious topics.
Please remember to respect each other's points of view, even if you don't relate to or agree with them.
I will do my best to facilitate these discussions, but I ask that you do your part as well to keep these discussions respectful.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Pet Peeves and Pop Ups [20 min]

*Thinking about assumptions, judgments, and making mistakes.*

### Prompts

For this exercise, we're going to split into groups of 3 to 4.
Rearrange yourselves so that you can all discuss with the other members of your group.

We will go through the following prompts, which you will discuss with your group.

#### Sharing Pet Peeves

Before we continue, I will provide a piece of scratch paper and a pen to each group.
*Make sure everybody in your group writes down their names on the scratch paper.
This is the sign-in sheet for today.*

Take 1 to 2 minutes to share your pet peeves with the other people in your group.
To give an example, a pet peeve that became popular on [the UC Davis subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis) was about [gym etiquette](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/be03ow/gym_etiquette/).
One of my pet peeves that I will explain further in class has to do with bicycling.

#### Pet Peeves and Your Feelings

Take 5 minutes to discuss with other people in your group how seeing that behavior makes you feel.
I will share my own feelings about my pet peeve mentioned above.

#### Personifying Your Pet Peeves

I'll ask everyone to close their eyes.
Take a moment to see what image of a person pops into your head when you think about your pet peeve.
When you have an image in your mind, keep your eyes closed but raise your hand.
After everyone has thought of an image, I will ask everyone to open their eyes.

### Discussion

Once everyone has opened their eyes, we will come back together as one group.

#### Sharing Adjectives

After we have come back together, I will ask people to share adjectives that describe people who personify your pet peeve.
I will share my own adjectives from my own personification.

#### Being Quick to Judge

Think of a time when you thought someone was being rude or selfish, but it turned out that something else was going on and you had been too quick to judge.

I will ask anyone if they want to share their experiences.
Depending on how the conversation flows, I can share two of my experiences about being both the quick judge and the quickly judged.

#### The Impact of Our Assumptions

To wrap up, consider the following two questions.
I will give you a bit of time to consider your answers, then we will briefly discuss your answers.

* How do the assumptions we make impact *us*? For example, do you get annoyed with someone based on those assumptions?
* How do the assumptions we make impact *other people*? For example, are you less friendly or polite to someone who has done something that annoyed you?

At the end of this topic, I will collect the papers that each group wrote on, as this is the attendance for today.
I will ask if anyone forgot to sign in.

## Climate and Learning Outcomes [30 min]

*How does our learning environment influence how effectively we learn?*

### Reading from Last Week

The reading from last week was only the introduction to the book; you can find the entire book on [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/stuck-shallow-end) if you're interested.
Their study's focus was at the high school level, but most of the ideas still apply here at the university level.

I'll ask how you think the reading relates to the idea of classroom climate.
The reading didn't explicitly mention the idea, but certain portions of the reading (such as the lack of students of color enrolled in computing-related courses) tie into what we're about to discuss further.

### Reflection

After we discuss the reading, we will take some time to reflect on our own experiences with classroom climate.
Take approximately 10 minutes to respond to the following questions.
I suggest that you write down your responses via your preferred medium, but I am not requiring you to.
I will provide scratch paper and pens if you would like to write out your thoughts on paper.

*Due to the nature of the topic, I will not collect any of your writings for this topic.
Share whatever you feel comfortable with sharing; don't feel pressured to share something that makes you uncomfortable.*

* Can you think of a time when you felt as though you didn't belong in a class? Why do you think you felt that way? Were there things that the instructor or other students did to make you feel that way (or make the feeling stronger)? What impact do you think that had on your ability to learn effectively in that class?
* Can you think of a time when you felt very at home in a class? What contributed to your comfort level? What did you have in common with the instructor or the other students?
* Have you noticed any predictable patterns for when you're likely to feel comfortable in a class and when you're likely to feel out of place? Is it related to:
    * the subject?
    * the way the class is being taught?
    * your own level of knowledge going in?
    * feeling like the only person of a certain identity in the room?
* Based on the conversations we've had so far, can you think of things that you can do (or avoid doing) to help other students feel comfortable?

### Discussion

After the reflection, I will ask everybody to come back together.
We will spend the remainder of the class discussing our responses that we are comfortable with sharing.
Depending on how the conversation flows, I may bring up my own responses to the reflection.

## Assignment for This Week

*Introducing the concept of Universal Design for Learning.*

### Reading

Read through *Universal Design: Implications for Computing Education* by Sheryl Burgstahler of the University of Washington, Seattle.
This was originally published in *ACM Transactions on Computing Education* in 2011.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Readings?preview=5760336).
We will start discussing Universal Design for Learning (UDL) next week, which continues our discussion on inclusiveness and climate.

### Review

The review format is adapted from the format for the [paper reviews for ECS 201C](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS201C/blob/master/syllabus.md#paper-reviews) by Jason Lowe-Power.

Write a review of the reading above.
Your review should contain two short paragraphs:

1. A short summary of the reading, and any key insights or implications.
2. Your own thoughts about the reading. Anything that stood out or resonated with you, or a topic/question about it for next week.

Submit your review in the [assignment for this week on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310490).

### Grading

I'm looking to see if you read the paper.
I am not going to grade this that harshly.
That being said, if it's clear from your review that you didn't read the paper, you may not receive full credit.
