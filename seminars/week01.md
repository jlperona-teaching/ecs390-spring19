# Week 1

This week's focus is on an introduction to the class and beginning to think about how you learn.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Introductions [5 min]

*Get to know each other a little bit better.*

### Facilitator Introduction

I'll introduce myself to the class.
So that you (hopefully) trust me and believe that I know what I'm doing, I'll go over my background and why I'm qualified to teach this class.

### Student Introductions

Then, you'll introduce yourself to somebody next to you that you don't know.
The first day sets the tone for the rest of the course.
I need to get you used to talking so that you'll continue to participate.

Potential ways you can introduce yourself to your partner:

* Your name, major, and year
* What you hope to get out of this class
* Your research focus (mine's computer science education)
* Your favorite restaurant in Davis (mine's Thai Canteen)

## Guidelines and Expectations [10 min]

*My plans and your hopes for this class.*

### What Can You Expect?

This is a TA training program, with a focus on creating an inclusive climate for all.
You can expect there to be a lot of discussion, and to be exposed to concepts you may not have seen before.
You can also expect this to be a safe space for you to communicate your experiences and ideas.

This is a new curriculum, one which I've never tried before.
You can expect there to be some stumbles along the way.
I ask that you be patient with me and be open to trying new things.

### What Do I Expect of You?

Some of these expectations are adapted from Kathy Obear's [*Suggested List of Learning Guidelines*](https://drkathyobear.com/).

* *Listen respectfully.* Even if you disagree with somebody, seek to understand why they feel that way.
* *Be open to new and different perspectives.* Nobody should feel ostracized because their perspective is different from somebody else.
* *Respect and maintain confidentiality.* The wisdom you get from this class can leave the room, but people's words stay here.
* *Engage the opportunity!* You'll get the most out of this course if you participate.

## Technology Pact [10 min]

*Agree on how we should use technology in this class.*

### Reasoning

Under construction.

### Voting

Under construction.

## Initial Reflection About Learning [10 min]

*Think about how you, as a student, learn while in a class.*

### Brainstorming

After this, we're going to be talking about learning styles and strategies.
To get you in the proper mindset for the discussion, I want you to reflect on how you, as a *student* (not an instructor), learn.
You're a graduate student in computer science at UC Davis.
You needed to have done well at your previous institution to get here, so you have probably found a system that works for you.

Take out your preferred method of brainstorming.
I'll have some pens and some scratch paper up front if you need it, but you can also write on your laptop or phone if you think it's more conducive to brainstorming.
Write down your thoughts.
I'm not going to be collecting this, nor will you be graded on it.
This is solely for your benefit and to help guide the discussion that follows.

### Reflection Prompts

Here are some ways you can approach this reflection.
You aren't bound to these, so if you think of something else you'd like to write down that's relevant, feel free.

* How do I approach a new assignment? Do I make a plan? Do I start right away? Do I discuss it with anyone?
* What conditions make it easiest for me to do my homework? How often do I do my homework under these conditions?
* What do I do when I don't understand something or am struggling to complete an assignment? How does it make me feel?
* How long do I try to work something out on my own before asking for help? Where do I usually go for help?
* Do I always approach my schoolwork in the same way or do I try out different strategies? Do I approach different subjects in different ways?
* What motivates me to do my work? What does "doing well" in a class mean to me? How do I react when I don't do well?

## Talking About Learning [15 min]

*Come back together and talk about what you've reflected on.*

### Discussion

For the remainder of the class, we'll talk about what we just reflected on.
There are no right answers to this; everybody has their own system that works for them.

### Prompts

At the start, I'll ask if anyone is willing to share what they've written down.
I'll share my own answers if the discussion permits.

From there, I'll allow the discussion to flow naturally.
If there's a lull, I'll ask the following, but we're not required to get to them all.

* Have you spent much time thinking about how you learn before? Or was this new?
* What kinds of things did you notice when you were reflecting?
* Were there any areas where what you thought you should be doing and what you actually do were different? Was that a difficult thing to admit?
* Are there any ways in which you think you learn differently than many others? What kinds of challenges do you think other people run into?

## Assignment for This Week

*Preparing for next week and beyond.*

### Discussion Leaders

On [Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010), you'll have an assignment every week.
The assignment is *usually* due at 16:00 on the following Monday.

For [this week's assignment](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310478), tell me if you're currently TAing or not.
If you are, and you're also leading discussions, I'll need a list of when and where those take place.
See the assignment page for more information.

### Reading for Next Week

Also, read through the first chapter of *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success* by Carol Dweck.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Readings?preview=5628174).
You don't need to write a summary or anything like that.
However, you should go through the two questionnaires and figure out what type of mindset you have for both intelligence and personality.
(If you're disappointed with the mindsets you got, reread the last sentence of the chapter again.)
