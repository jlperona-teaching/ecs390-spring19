# Week 1

This week's focus is on an introduction to the class and beginning to think about how you learn.

## Introductions [5 min]

*Get to know each other a little bit better.*

### Facilitator Introduction

I'll introduce myself to the class.
So that you (hopefully) trust me and believe that I know what I'm doing, I'll go over my background and why I'm qualified to teach this class.

### Student Introductions

Then, you'll introduce yourself to somebody next to you that you don't know.
The first day sets the tone for the rest of the course.
I need to get you used to talking so that you'll continue to participate.

Potential ways you can introduce yourself to your partner:

* Your name, major, and year
* What you hope to get out of this class
* Your research focus (mine's computer science education)
* Your favorite restaurant in Davis (mine's Thai Canteen)

## Guidelines and Expectations [10 min]

*My plans and your hopes for this class.*

Under construction.

## Technology Pact [10 min]

*Agree on how we should use technology in this class.*

Under construction.

## Initial Reflection About Learning [10 min]

*Think about how you, as a student, learn while in a class.*

Under construction.

## Talking About Learning [15 min]

*Come back together and talk about what you've reflected on.*

Under construction.

## Assignment for This Week

*Preparing for next week and beyond.*

### Discussion Leaders

On [Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010), you'll have an assignment every week.
The assignment is *usually* due at 16:00 on the following Monday.

For [this week's assignment](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310478), tell me if you're currently TAing or not.
If you are, and you're also leading discussions, I'll need a list of when and where those take place.
See the assignment page for more information.

### Reading for Next Week

Also, read through the first chapter of *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success* by Carol Dweck.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Readings?preview=5628174).
You don't need to write a summary or anything like that.
However, you should go through the two questionnaires and figure out what type of mindset you have for both intelligence and personality.
(If you're disappointed with the mindsets you got, reread the last sentence of the chapter again.)
