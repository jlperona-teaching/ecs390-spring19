# Week 1

This week's focus is on an introduction to the class and beginning to think about how you learn.

The majority of the content for this week was derived from the [*MaGE* Resources](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum/home) provided by the *MaGE* Program.

## Introductions [5 min]

*Get to know each other a little bit better.*

### Facilitator Introduction

I'll introduce myself to the class.
So that you (hopefully) trust me and believe that I know what I'm doing, I'll go over my background and why I'm qualified to teach this class.

### Student Introductions

Then, you'll introduce yourself to somebody next to you that you don't know.
The first day sets the tone for the rest of the course.
I need to get you used to talking so that you'll continue to participate.

Potential ways you can introduce yourself to your partner:

* Your name, major, and year
* What you hope to get out of this class
* Your research focus (mine's computer science education, popularly known as computing education research or CER)
* Your favorite restaurant in Davis (mine's Thai Canteen)

## Guidelines and Expectations [10 min]

*My plans and your hopes for this class.*

### What Can You Expect?

This is a TA training program, with a focus on creating an inclusive climate for all.
You can expect there to be a lot of discussion, and to be exposed to concepts you may not have seen before.
You can also expect this to be a safe space for you to communicate your experiences and ideas.

This is a new curriculum, one which I've never tried before.
You can expect there to be some stumbles along the way.
I ask that you be patient with me and be open to trying new things.

### What Do I Expect of You?

Some of these expectations are adapted from Kathy Obear's [*Suggested List of Learning Guidelines*](https://drkathyobear.com/).

* *Listen respectfully.* Even if you disagree with somebody, seek to understand why they feel that way.
* *Be open to new and different perspectives.* Nobody should feel ostracized because their perspective is different from somebody else.
* *Respect and maintain confidentiality.* The wisdom you get from this class can leave the room, but people's words stay here.
* *Engage the opportunity!* You'll get the most out of this course if you participate.

## Technology Pact [10 min]

*Agree on how we should use technology in this class.*

### Explanation

We're going to come to a consensus regarding a policy on the use of technology during this class.
I want you to have a say, instead of me dictating the policy outright.

### Reflection and Discussion

Take a bit of time to think about how much you pay attention in class where you can't use technology.
Compare this to your attention in a class where there are no restrictions on how much you use technology.

After a while, I'll ask the class to share their observations.
How does technology impact your ability to focus, if it does at all?

### Personal Impact

In a lecture-based class, I (as the lecturer) don't mind if my students are using technology.
Some of them might be taking notes on their laptops.
That being said, some of my students may not feel the same way, if somebody's laptop in front of them is distracting.
I haven't taught a discussion-based course before, so I can't speak to its impact.

As a student, I try my best to avoid using technology.
It's definitely a distraction, as the course I took last quarter proved.
I don't mind using my phone to check the time or see if I received a notification, but any more than that interrupts my focus on the class.

As an aside, you don't need to take notes in this class if you don't want to.
All these seminar notes are provided online, and I will make sure to post anything else you need on GitHub or Canvas.

### Voting

You'll vote for the policy that you'd like me to implement in this class.
Your choices are the following:

1. No restrictions of any kind.
2. No restrictions on laptops and tablets, but no cell phone use.
3. No technology during the discussion portions of the class, your best judgment the rest of the time.
4. No technology at any time.

I will pass out a ballot to each person.
Please write your name on the ballot, as this will serve as the sign in sheet for today.
Indicate your policy preference on the sheet, or abstain by not marking one.

*Only I will know exactly how you voted.
I will not reveal your specific choice to anyone else.
What you choose will have no impact on your grade, as I am only grading on attendance.*

### Results

I will collect the ballots and count them.
When I have finished counting, I will confirm the result with the class and make sure that you understand what this policy means.
You will have a chance to ask any questions or raise any concerns before we move on.

After class is over, I will add the policy to the [syllabus](../syllabus/syllabus.md).
I will (politely) enforce the policy in future classes, if required.

## Initial Reflection About Learning [10 min]

*Think about how you, as a student, learn while in a class.*

### Brainstorming

After this, we're going to be talking about learning styles and strategies.
To get you in the proper mindset for the discussion, I want you to reflect on how you, as a *student* (not an instructor), learn.
You're a graduate student in computer science at UC Davis.
You needed to have done well at your previous institution to get here, so you have probably found a system that works for you.

Take out your preferred method of brainstorming.
I'll have some pens and some scratch paper up front if you need it, but you can also write on your laptop or phone if you think it's more conducive to brainstorming.
Write down your thoughts.
I'm not going to be collecting this, nor will you be graded on it.
This is solely for your benefit and to help guide the discussion that follows.

### Reflection Prompts

Here are some ways you can approach this reflection.
You aren't bound to these, so if you think of something else you'd like to write down that's relevant, feel free.

* How do I approach a new assignment? Do I make a plan? Do I start right away? Do I discuss it with anyone?
* What conditions make it easiest for me to do my homework? How often do I do my homework under these conditions?
* What do I do when I don't understand something or am struggling to complete an assignment? How does it make me feel?
* How long do I try to work something out on my own before asking for help? Where do I usually go for help?
* Do I always approach my schoolwork in the same way or do I try out different strategies? Do I approach different subjects in different ways?
* What motivates me to do my work? What does "doing well" in a class mean to me? How do I react when I don't do well?

## Talking About Learning [15 min]

*Come back together and talk about what you've reflected on.*

### Discussion

For the remainder of the class, we'll talk about what we just reflected on.
There are no right answers to this; everybody has their own system that works for them.

### Prompts

At the start, I'll ask if anyone is willing to share what they've written down.
I'll share my own answers if the discussion permits.

From there, I'll allow the discussion to flow naturally.
If there's a lull, I'll ask the following, but we're not required to get to them all.

* Have you spent much time thinking about how you learn before? Or was this new?
* What kinds of things did you notice when you were reflecting?
* Were there any areas where what you thought you should be doing and what you actually do were different? Was that a difficult thing to admit?
* Are there any ways in which you think you learn differently than many others? What kinds of challenges do you think other people run into?

## Assignment for This Week

*Preparing for next week and beyond.*

### Discussion Leaders

On [Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010), you'll have an assignment every week.
The assignment is *usually* due at 16:00 on the following Monday.

For [this week's assignment](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments/310478), write down whether or not you're TAing this quarter, and if you're leading discussions.
It should take you a couple of minutes at most.
If you're not leading discussions, that's all you need to write.

If you are leading discussions, please give the class, days, times, and rooms that you're leading discussions in.
If you're not consistently leading discussions at the same time every week (because you're splitting that duty with someone else, or for any other reason) please also give the dates that you'll be leading discussions.

### Reading for Next Week

Also, read through the first chapter of *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success* by Carol Dweck of Stanford University.
You can find a PDF in the [Files section on Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/files/folder/Readings?preview=5628174).
You don't need to write a summary or anything like that.
However, you should go through the two questionnaires and figure out what type of mindset you have for both intelligence and personality.
(If you're disappointed with the mindsets you got, re-read the last sentence of the chapter again.)
