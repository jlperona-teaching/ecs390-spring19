# ECS 390 - The Teaching of Computer Science

Inspiration for this course was drawn from the following people or programs:

* *Jason Lowe-Power* of UC Davis for the layout of the course
* *Sean Davis* of UC Davis for some of the course content
* the *MaGE* program at Mount Holyoke College for the majority of the course content

## About the Course

### Curriculum

This quarter is going to be a huge experiment for ECS 390.
I'm going to be trying out a new curriculum, heavily based on the [*Megas and Gigas Educate* (MaGE)](https://sites.google.com/a/mtholyoke.edu/mage/) program developed at [Mount Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/).
As they state on their website, MaGE is designed to:

* raise awareness of the role of social identity in learning
* emphasize active learning within computer science
* provide preparation for being technical peer mentors

Since I'm not copying their program exactly, we may not get to everything on this list, but I certainly hope to.
My hope for this curriculum change is to make it more useful for students who already have teaching experience, which there should be a few of in this class.

This is very much an experiment!
I'll be asking for your feedback to determine if the class was useful for you depending on the amount of prior teaching experience you've had.
I hope that you'll give your feedback, as I'll take this into consideration for future classes.

### Description

Participation as a Teaching Assistant or Associate-In in a designated engineering course.
Methods of leading discussion groups or lab sections, writing and grading quizzes, use of lab equipment, and grading lab reports.
May be repeated for credit.

### Objectives

1. Student will develop the skills to effectively lead responsive, informative discussion sections.
2. Student will be able to develop efficient and fair methods of grading student programs and tests.
3. Student will learn about the various resources available to student instructors on campus.

The whole point of this class is for you to improve as an instructor.
I get to improve as an instructor as well by teaching this class, so everyone wins!
It doesn't matter if you've had previous experience teaching or not, you can *always* improve your teaching and make things better.

## Websites

### GitHub

GitHub will serve as the open-source repository for some of the course content, including the syllabus (this document), the schedule, any presentation notes I post, and the layout for each week's class.

I'm a big fan of making things open-source wherever possible, hence this repository.
My GitHub repository for [ECS 154A](https://github.com/jlperona-teaching/ecs154a-ssii18), a class I taught previously, is a good past example of that.

### Canvas

[Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010) will serve as the discussion board for the class, as well as where you'll submit your assignments and get back your grades.

Feel free to post questions on the [Discussions tab](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/discussion_topics) of Canvas.
I'll make any announcements on the [Announcements tab](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/356010/assignments).

## Coursework

### Grading

The course is graded on a Satisfactory / Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis.
There are 30 points possible, described in more detail in the sections below.
You need at least 80% of the points possible to get an S, as is typical of S/U classes at UC Davis.
Thus, if you end up missing a class or assignment once, don't worry about it.

A brief breakdown is below:

| *Category*    | *Weight* | *Explanation*                           |
|---------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Attendance    | 60%      | 9 seminars x 2 points each = 18 points  |
| Assignments   | 30%      | 9 assignments x 1 point each = 9 points |
| Observation   | 10%      | 3 points                                |
| **Total**     | *100%*   | *30 points*                             |

### Attendance

Attendance for each class is mandatory.
This will be a course heavily based on discussion, so to get the most out of the course, you'll need to attend most weeks.

You get two points for each class you attend.
There are 9 classes, so you get 18 points from attendance.

### Weekly Assignments

In addition to the attendance, there will usually be something that you need to submit on Canvas for that week as well.
These are *usually* due at 16:00 on the following Monday, an hour before class, but check the due date carefully.
Assignments will revolve around the following:

* reflection on something discussed in class that week
* reading(s) for the following week
* feedback on the course

You get one point for each assignment.
There are 9 assignments, so you get 9 points from assignments.

### Observation

#### Reasoning

Normally, in this course, the instructor would observe TAs who are leading discussions that quarter.
Due to this, students who weren't leading discussions the quarter they took the class wouldn't get an observation of their teaching skills.
Making things truly equal for students taking this class would require one of the following:

* only allowing students who are currently leading discussions to take this class
* giving everybody taking this class a TA position in which they lead discussions

Both of these solutions are untenable for a variety of reasons.
While I can't make things equal, I can try to make things more equitable.
This quarter is already a huge experiment, so we're going to try a new assignment and see if it works out.

#### Assignment

I won't be observing TAs who are leading discussions this quarter.
Instead, every student in the class will observe a discussion section of one of those TAs.
This includes those who are leading discussions; you'll observe another TA.
You will take notes and give suggestions to the TA on how they can improve their teaching.
More about the assignment is explained on the assignment page on Canvas.

After the first week of class, I'll post a list of when and where the discussion sections led by our students are being held.
You'll sign up for spots; only one observation per discussion will be allowed.
We will try to be fair and make it so that each TA gets roughly the same amount of observations over the quarter.

This is the term project for this class, essentially.
You'll get up to three points for doing this, depending on the quality of your notes.
